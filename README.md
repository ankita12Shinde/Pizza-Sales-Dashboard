## Project Insight
The Pizza Sale Report in Power BI provides key insights into the sales performance of a pizza business. It highlights top-selling pizzas, analyzes revenue trends over time, and offers a breakdown of customer preferences by pizza type, size, or toppings. The report identifies peak sales times, such as the busiest hours or days, and compares regional performance across different locations or outlets. These insights help refine sales strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Final Conculsion 
The final conclusion of the pizza sale report is that analyzing sales data helps understand customer choices, busy times, and best-selling pizzas. This information can be used to manage stock better, create effective marketing, and improve customer experience, leading to more sales and smoother operations.
